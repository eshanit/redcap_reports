NCD data cleaning algorithm:

1. Remove all data which is not of that facility
	- DELETE from redcap_data where project_id = 59 and not record like 'MPH%';
	
2. Now that you are left with data for that facility, there is data with old event_id's
   so check new event_ids
   - SELECT * FROM redcap_events_metadata where arm_id = '114'; 
   this will give you a range of events 
   
3. Now delete all records who are not in the event range:
	- DELETE FROM redcap_data where project_id = 59 and event_id < 5641;
	
	done:
